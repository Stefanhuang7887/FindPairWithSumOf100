# FindPairWithSumOf100

This Java code takes:
  an array from input.txt
    Where in input.txt, the first line is an integet n (he size of the array) and the next x lines contains the numbers in the array
outputs:
  all the unique pairs with sum of 100 
  and on the last line states how many unique pairs are found. 
  
 I have included a couple of sample input/output files here.
